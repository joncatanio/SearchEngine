Quick Setup Guide:

This guide assumes that the user has MySQL 5.7+ installed and has a user
with CREATE, CREATE_USER, GRANT_OPTION, DROP, INDEX, SELECT, and UPDATE
privileges.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To quickly setup the database run the command below:

$ mysql -u <user> -p < setup.mysql

To cleanup everything done by the setup script run the command below:

$ mysql -u <user> -p < cleanup.mysql

Note: <user> must have all aforementioned privileges.
